                        <br>  <b>Tarantulas</b> comprise a group of large and often hairy spiders of the family Theraphosidae. 
                        <br>  As of August 2022, 1,040 species have been identified, with 156 genera. 
                        <br>  The term "tarantula" is usually used to describe members of the family Theraphosidae, 
                        <br>  although many other members of the same infraorder (Mygalomorphae) are commonly referred 
                        <br>  to as "tarantulas" or "false tarantulas". Some of the more common species have become 
                        <br>  popular in the exotic pet trade. Many New World species kept as pets have setae known 
                        <br>  as urticating hairs that can cause irritation to the skin, and in extreme cases, 
                        <br>  cause damage to the eyes.

                <br>    <b>Tarantulas</b> can be confused with other members of the order Mygalomorphae, such as trapdoor spiders, 
                <br>    funnel-web spiders and purseweb spiders. They can also be confused with some members of the order 
                <br>    Araneomorphae such as the Lycosidae family. There are multiple ways to identify a tarantula. 
                <br>    First the hairs: in the Americas most tarantulas have urticating hairs, though some, such as the 
                <br>    Hemirrhagus genus, lack these. The hairs are usually more noticeable than with most other spiders. 
                <br>    Another is the size, as tarantulas tend to be bigger, but this is again not a failproof way. 
                <br>    They also do not use their webs for hunting, instead using them as building material or tripwire.
